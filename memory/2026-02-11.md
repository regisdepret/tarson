# 2026-02-11 Daily Notes

## Improvements Made Today

### Inbox Zero Workflow
- Fixed orphan tracking emails issue: now removing Tracking label (Label_81) when completing tasks
- Updated MEMORY.md with proper workflow: Track → Task → Complete → Remove Tracking label
- Cleaned up 4 stale tracking emails from completed tasks

### Voice Message Workflow
- Confirmed voice-to-voice response working
- When user sends audio → respond with audio (important for driving)
- Whisper transcription working (CPU-based, ~15-20s for short messages)

### GLM Model Upgrade
- Updated OpenClaw config from GLM-4 to GLM-4.5/4.7/5
- User has Coding Pro-Yearly plan with access to latest models
- Fallbacks now: gemini-2.5-pro → gemini-2.0-flash → glm-5 → glm-4.7

### Oracle ARM Auto-Retry
- Created `/scripts/oracle_arm_retry.sh`
- Specs: 4 OCPU / 24GB RAM Ampere A1 Flex
- Cron: every 5 minutes, tries all 3 Ashburn ADs
- Logs to `/logs/oracle_arm_retry.log`
- Will notify via OpenClaw system event on success
- 27 attempts so far, all "Out of host capacity" (normal)

### Quote Control - Lomax Job
- Updated job requirements (expanded scope)
- Captured Bentley's full quote: $23,999.33
- Captured GLM full quote: $17,668.80
- GLM is ~$6,300 cheaper
- Recalculated tread pricing (LF vs SF conversion)
- Still waiting on: Luxury Landscape, Stone Center, Heritage/Superior

### Tasks Completed
- Susan assessment visit ✓
- Grate install Roswell ✓
- TikTok login Shirley ✓
- TikTok Tucano Art Design login ✓
- OpenClaw #4830 (let close) ✓
- Google Maps, Google Dev, GoDaddy alerts ✓

### Technical Notes
- `grep` exit code 1 = no matches (not an error) - use `|| true` to suppress
- Edge TTS noted in TOOLS.md for future comparison

## Cron Jobs Status (Final)
- **Inbox Zero**: hourly at :30 ✅
- **Oracle ARM retry**: every 5 min ✅ (27+ attempts, still trying)
- **GitHub backup**: 6 AM & 6 PM ✅ (restored)
- **Weekly health**: Sunday 9 AM ✅ (restored)
- **Claude-mem dedupe/queue**: kept for user's other Claude CLI projects
- **Tradebotis**: REMOVED per user request

## Late Afternoon Updates
- Audio message investigation task completed - confirmed working, delay is just CPU whisper time
- GLM sent official PDF quote for Lomax via email (pending review)
- Clarified claude-mem vs OpenClaw memory systems - they're separate
- User confirmed voice-to-voice workflow working well

## Key Learnings
- Voice messages: respond with voice (user may be driving)
- GLM prices in linear feet, Bentley's in square feet - convert for comparison
- grep exit code 1 = no matches, not error - use `|| true`
- OpenClaw memory (MEMORY.md) separate from claude-mem (SQLite)
