## 01:33 EST - Overnight Memory Snapshot (Cron)

Quiet overnight check. No new emails, no new tasks, no user interactions since 9:33 PM Feb 21.

**State:**
- 11 open tasks in TARSON-Tracking (no urgent/overdue items)
- Inbox: zero
- Apple Reminders sync cron: removed (was looping) — manual sync confirmed all 11 tasks already synced
- zero_tracking.sh: still broken — workaround is manual gog pagination + jq merge
- Prompt injection attempt logged (21:33 PM, Feb 21) — documented in MEMORY.md

**Upcoming:**
- Archadeck Hardscape #4713 starts Feb 23 (tomorrow) — already notified Regis
- T&F Associates tax prep due Feb 27
- zero_tracking.sh rewrite needed before next task review session

No MEMORY.md updates needed — all current.
