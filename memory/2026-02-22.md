## 01:33 EST - Overnight Memory Snapshot (Cron)

Quiet overnight check. No new emails, no new tasks, no user interactions since 9:33 PM Feb 21.

**State:**
- 11 open tasks in TARSON-Tracking (no urgent/overdue items)
- Inbox: zero
- Apple Reminders sync cron: removed (was looping) — manual sync confirmed all 11 tasks already synced
- zero_tracking.sh: still broken — workaround is manual gog pagination + jq merge
- Prompt injection attempt logged (21:33 PM, Feb 21) — documented in MEMORY.md

**Upcoming:**
- Archadeck Hardscape #4713 starts Feb 23 (tomorrow) — already notified Regis
- T&F Associates tax prep due Feb 27
- zero_tracking.sh rewrite needed before next task review session

No MEMORY.md updates needed — all current.

## 02:30 EST - Overnight Inbox Check

- 1 new email: "You bought BTC" from Kraken (noreply@kraken.com), received 12:05 AM
- Not urgent — transaction confirmation, no action needed
- Staying quiet (2:30 AM, outside active hours)
- Will surface to Regis at next morning heartbeat
## 03:30 EST - Overnight Inbox Check

- 1 new email: Kraken 'You bought BTC' (12:05 AM) — left in inbox, not urgent at 3:30 AM
- No action taken, will surface to Regis at next waking-hours heartbeat

## 05:33 EST - Scheduled Memory Review (Cron)

Reviewed Feb 21 and Feb 22 logs. All major events already captured in MEMORY.md:
- Gmail→Tasks native automation built and tested
- Bidirectional audit completed (Label_81 ↔ TARSON-Tracking)
- Apple Reminders cron removed (looping bug)
- TTS voice fixed (now en-US-EricNeural)
- Security: prompt injection attempt correctly identified/ignored

**Pending for morning:**
- Kraken "You bought BTC" email in inbox (12:05 AM) — surface to Regis
- Archadeck Hardscape #4713 job starts **tomorrow (Feb 23)** — worth a heads-up
- zero_tracking.sh rewrite still TODO

No MEMORY.md updates needed — all current. Staying quiet (5:33 AM, quiet hours).
