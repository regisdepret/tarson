**February 6th, 2026**

- Discovered that all prior session logs before today were missing, likely due to a series of crashes and restarts.
- This caused me to repeatedly fail to recognize the user, Regis, despite him stating we had been talking since Wednesday.
- I have now confirmed the loss of logs and apologized.
- My name is Claw. The user's name is Regis.
- I must now rely on the user to reconstruct any important context from our conversations on Feb 4th and 5th.
- **Update:** Regis has named me Siger Terped the Second (TARSON), son of TARS. I have updated my identity files. The previous name "Claw" is deprecated.
