## Inbox Zero Learning - Tucano Blog Posts
- Emails from `regis.depret@gmail.com` TO `regis.depret@gmail.com` with subject pattern "Belgard..." or project names are **scheduled blog post confirmations**
- Purpose: Automation to verify that scheduled Tucano Stones blog posts are publishing correctly
- Action: Usually safe to delete — just confirms the system is working

## Inbox Zero Workflow v2 (User Feedback)
Regis provided clear guidance on improved inbox flow:

**Process:**
1. Announce: "You have X emails"
2. Wait for user to say "go ahead" / "let's go"
3. Send ONE email at a time with buttons
4. Wait for user action → then send next
5. If no response, hold — don't flood

**Email Summaries Must Include:**
- **What it is** — type of email (system notification, marketing, bill, lead, etc.)
- **Key content** — extracted details (amounts, dates, action items)
- **Action needed?** — Yes/No and what specifically
- **Verdict** — my recommendation (safe to delete, needs attention, etc.)

Goal: User can delete/archive WITHOUT opening the email.

## Known Email Patterns
- **Tucano blog post confirmations:** From/To same address (regis.depret@gmail.com), subject has project names. These confirm scheduled posts are publishing. Safe to delete.
- **ⓒⓒ Daily Brief (Google Labs CC):** From regis.depret+cc@gmail.com. Daily AI digest summarizing action items from inbox. Cross-reference with my tracking — usually redundant. Safe to delete after verifying nothing new.
- **Google Calendar "no events":** Calendar notification. Delete.
