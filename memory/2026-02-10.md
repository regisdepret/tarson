## Technical Discovery: OneDrive Photo Extraction
Found working method in session logs (session `443b2c4d-debc-45b1-89e1-6708e4e63164`):
1. Fetch email raw content (base64 encoded HTML)
2. Decode and grep for thumbnail URLs from OneDrive HTML
3. Download photos via curl with temp auth tokens embedded in URLs
4. Save to `/home/regis/.openclaw/workspace/temp/onedrive_memories/`
5. Send via message tool with `media` param

**Key insight:** OAuth flow is NOT required - the email HTML contains pre-authenticated thumbnail URLs that work for a limited time. Extract and download immediately.

## System Notes
- Heartbeat cron working via system crontab (not OpenClaw internal cron)
- Command: `openclaw system event --mode now` at :30 every hour

## Technical Learning: Gmail Label Removal
- `thread modify --remove INBOX` silently fails (reports success but doesn't work)
- `batch modify --remove INBOX` actually works
- Always use `batch modify` for removing labels from messages

## Quote Control System (NEW FEATURE)

### Overview
Hybrid system for tracking supplier quotes on job materials. Combines Google Tasks (workflow) + Google Sheets (comparison/data).

### Resources
- **Sheet:** [TucanoQuoteControl](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rwU_zPwOdeOQnkqgWeydxLrmGjAEG3c8S-gr7eLuaM4/edit)
- **Tasks List:** TARSON - Quote Control (ID: `YTFXWENrb28xeUg0UTdEcw`)
- **Contacts Sheet:** [TucanoContacts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nUQ1RahVD5vRxsGNqIA0QIHUDVv3ucCF1ij55RW0kTk/edit)

### Workflow
1. User sends fragment (screenshot, voice, text) about quote request
2. I create master task: `[JOB] <JobName> - <Description>`
3. Each supplier becomes subtask: `[QUOTE] <Supplier> - <Status>`
4. Add row to Quote Control sheet with details
5. As quotes come in, update task status + sheet with prices
6. User picks winner → mark others completed, winner stays open
7. Job completes → complete master task
