- **Inbox Zero Automation:** During the 04:30 EST hourly inbox check, both the Gmail and iCloud fetch commands failed.
    - **Gmail:** I had used `gog gmail list` instead of the correct `gog gmail search`. I identified the correct command from the tool's help output and fixed the process.
    - **iCloud:** The `scripts/icloud_inbox_fetch.sh` script failed with an `AttributeError` when no unread messages were found. I debugged the Python script, found it was trying to call `.split()` on a `None` object, and patched it to handle cases with zero unread emails gracefully.
- Successfully ran the corrected scripts and processed the inboxes for both the 04:30 and 05:30 cycles.
