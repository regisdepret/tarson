**Action:** Sync state NOT updated. Will retry when MacMini comes back online.
**Fix needed:** Enable TLS on gateway (wss://) or adjust security config for MacMini node.

## 05:33 EST - Memory Review (Cron)

Reviewed recent history (Feb 20-21 logs). No new session activity since 4:14 AM sync attempt.

**MEMORY.md updates made:**
1. Added `leo@tucanostones.com` broken Google Workspace account to Business Context
2. Updated MacMini pending sync count to 20 tasks

**Pending items worth flagging to Regis when awake:**
- `leo@tucanostones.com` is bouncing (550) — emails to Leo are silently failing
- Sawnee EMC: $201.27 task shows due Feb 19 (past due) but payment was confirmed posted Feb 20 — old task may need to be completed
- MacMini Apple Reminders sync still broken — 20 tasks accumulating

## 10:45-11:00 EST - Gateway & MacMini Fix Session

**Problem:** Gateway restart (Feb 20) introduced WS plaintext security check, blocking all CLI tools and inbox cron. MacMini also disconnected.

**Fix applied:**
1. Gateway: `bind=lan` + `tls.enabled=true` → now serves `wss://192.168.4.252:18789`
2. Crontab: added `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` to inbox cron command (self-signed cert)
3. MacMini: Regis ran `openclaw node install --force --tls --tls-fingerprint F2:A1...` → reconnected
4. MacMini IP confirmed: 192.168.5.31 (SSH works via `ssh regis@192.168.5.31`)

**Apple Reminders Sync - 6 new tasks synced:**
- [TAX] Coinbase 1099-DA - Review missing cost basis for 2025
- [BILL] Sawnee EMC - Payment posted Feb 20, 2026
- [WATCHING] Serasa/SABESP - Natalino water bills
- [BILL] Sawnee EMC - $201.27 (due Feb 19)
- [DELIVERY] Amazon Subscribe & Save - Kerasal Nail Patches (due Feb 27)
- [PACKAGE] Amazon - Arriving Soon

Sync state updated → 36 total synced IDs.

**Note:** `nodes` tool shows "unknown node: MacMinoris" after reinstall (new ID assigned). Use SSH+osascript as fallback. Cert fingerprint: F2:A1:DB:AA:7C:DD:21:F3:2B:BD:2A:A0:ED:63:C4:39:B5:7F:70:EB:17:A4:6F:88:22:27:52:24:D0:68:05:76

## 12:37 PM - Memory Flush

**Inbox Zero Workflow Changes (User-directed):**
1.  **iCloud checks disabled:** User confirmed iCloud now forwards all mail to Gmail. The `inbox_fetch_all.sh` script has been updated to query Gmail only.
2.  **"Track" behavior updated:** The new procedure is to add `Label_81` and mark as read, but **keep the email in the INBOX**. The user prefers this for visual tracking. `MEMORY.md` and `rules/inbox_zero.md` have been updated to reflect this new standard operating procedure.

**TUI Access:**
- User created a wrapper script `scripts/tui.sh` and an alias `otui` to handle the self-signed TLS certificate issue, allowing the TUI to connect successfully.

**Inbox Status (12:30 PM):**
- Processed 6 unread emails.
- Handled a Google Security alert regarding an App Password creation for "Coinbasemails" (user confirmed it was them).
- Achieved inbox zero for `is:unread`.
- User reports seeing many read emails still in the inbox. Awaiting clarification to run a different search query.

## 13:33 PM - Memory Review

**Task Management Strategy Discussion:**
- User proposed a change to the task creation workflow to get native, clickable Gmail links in Google Tasks.
- **Proposed Method:** Use browser automation to click the "Add to Tasks" button in the Gmail UI for a specific email, then use the API to find and enrich the newly created task.
- **My Analysis:** The method is feasible but fragile (dependent on Gmail's UI) and slow (5-10 seconds per task vs. <1 second for API).
- **Counter-Proposal (Hybrid Approach):**
    - Continue using the fast, reliable API method for standard inbox zero triage.
    - On user command ("Track this one with the native link"), use the slower browser automation method for high-value or complex threads where the clickable link is most useful.
- **Status:** Awaiting user feedback on the hybrid approach.
